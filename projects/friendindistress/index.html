            <b>Immediate techniques:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Cold water: In order to calm down quickly, try holding your breath and putting your face in a bowl of cold water or holding a cold pack on your eyes and cheeks for at least 30 seconds.</li>
                <li>Intense exercise: Exercising intensely will help your body get rid of negative energy that can sometimes be stored from strong emotions. Get rid of this energy by running, walking at a fast pace, doing jumping jacks, etc. Exercise naturally releases endorphins which will help combat any negative emotions like anger, anxiety, or sadness.</li>

        <p class="card-text">
          When we are in crisis, we are not always thinking clearly. Preparing a safety plan in advance will help guide you when you are experiencing thoughts of self-harm or suicide. Think of it like knowing where the fire exits and extinguishers are!<br/><br/>
            <b>What <i>exactly</i> is a safety plan?</b><br/>
            There are usually five components to a safety plan:
            <ol>
            <li><b>Warning signs:</b> Your warning signs in the future may prevent things from escalating when they feel this way.</li>
            <li><b>Internal coping methods:</b> What has helped you in the past when you’ve felt this way. What activities can distract you from your thoughts.</li>
            <li><b>Social contacts</b> who can distract you from the crisis and family members or friends who can offer support.</li>
            <li><b>Professional contacts</b> and agencies to contact for help.</li>
            <li><b>Safe environment:</b> Maintaining a safe environment and limiting access to dangerous items.</li>
            </ol>
<b>I'm ready to safety plan. Where can I make one?</b>

<b>What is Anxiety?</b><br/>
Sometimes when we sense something is dangerous or threatening, we automatically go into a state called “anxious arousal”. This can happen when there is a real danger, but also when something simply feels dangerous, but really isn’t, such as giving an oral presentation in class, or…(give an example of something relevant to your child). Anxious arousal makes you feel jittery, on edge, and uncomfortable. It may also make it hard to think clearly. This feeling can become overwhelming enough that anxious people stop doing things or going places that make them feel anxious. Do you think this is happening to you? <br><br>
<span class="font-italic">Anxiety is Normal. 1 in 7 children experience anxiety.<br/>
Anxiety is not dangerous. It is temporary.<br/>
Anxiety is adaptive. It helped our ancestors survive.<br/><br/></span>
          
<b>Why do we have anxiety?</b><br/>
Imagine you are hiking in the woods and you come across a bear. What is the first thing you would do? You may run away from the bear, or you may simply freeze. Another reaction is to yell and wave your arms to appear big and scary. There are three ways humans react to danger: fight, flee, or freeze. <b>This is also known as a "fight-or-flight" response.</b> When we are anxious, we react in one of these ways, too. We may run away or avoid situations that make us anxious. Or we may freeze, such as when our minds go blank and we can’t think clearly. Or we may fight, get angry and lash out at people. Can you think of some ways you may fight, flee, or freeze because of anxious feelings?<br/><br/>

<b>When should I know when to seek help?</b><br/>
Take the example of a smoke alarm. Every house has one. An alarm can help protect us when there is an actual fire, but sometimes a smoke alarm is too sensitive and goes off when there isn’t really a fire (e.g. burning toast in toaster). Like a smoke alarm, anxiety is helpful when it works right. But when it goes off when there is no real danger, then we may want to fix it. <i>That</i> is a good sign to take action, and that begins with talking to a healthcare professional.<br/><br/>

          <b>What is disordered eating?</b></br>
Disordered eating are the thoughts and behaviours associated with eating disorders. It is connected to how a person feels about themselves and things that are going on in their life. </br></br>
                What are examples of disordered eating?</br>
        <ul>
            <li>Losing weight to meet an unrealistic body standard</li>
            <li>Eating a lot of food then throwing up or exercising excessively</li>
            <li>Never being happy with their weight</li>
            <li>Fear, shame, or guilt about gaining weight or their eating</li>
        </ul>
<b>I think I have disordered eating, how did I get it?</b></br>
Disordered eating is a common way to cope with problems and emotions. This can occur from negative self-esteem, body image issues, difficult problems (e.g., family loss, moving away), or problems at school with grades or bullying.
<br/><br/>
<i>You are not alone. Recovery is possible with treatment, time, and support.</i>
<br/><br/>

       <b>What can I do to reduce my disordered eating?</b><br/>
    Disordered eating is something to discuss with an adult. Like you would talk to a doctor about a physical problem such as a broken arm or leg, you can speak to a family or healthcare practitioner about disordered or any other mental distress.<br/><br/>

          Problematic substance use

          <b>What is problematic substance use?</b></br>
Many people will use substances (e.g. caffeine, prescription medication, alcohol, etc.) over the course of their lifetime without any problems. Substance use becomes a problem when it starts to have harmful effects on a person’s life (e.g. difficulties at school or at home, negative impacts on mental and/or physical health, etc.).</br></br>

  <b>Why do people use substances?
</b></br>
People use substances for a variety of reasons. Some may use substances out of curiosity, or because they’re influenced by their friends, family and/or peers. Some use it to feel good and some use it to tune out their feelings.<br/><br/>
Youth, like you, are vulnerable because your brain is still growing. You may also not know how much is "too much". You may also not consider all the long-term risks of substance use.</br></br>

  <b>When is substance use "problematic"?</b></br>
“Addiction” is a common term used to describe when a behaviour is out of control, usually in a harmful way. The meaning of addiction may vary by person or culture. When it comes to the risks and harms of substance use, we prefer to use the terms “problematic substance use” or “substance use problem,” which describe the use of a substance over time that causes negative effects (e.g. adverse physical, emotional and/or social impacts).</br></br>


       <b>I think I have problematic substance use. What do I do?</b><br/>
Struggling with substance use can be difficult, and completely stopping use is not easy. Withdrawal refers to the physical and emotional symptoms that a person experiences when they drastically reduce their substance use or completely stop using substances (going “cold turkey”). Signs and symptoms of withdrawal can include anything from mild discomfort (such as a headache) to seizures. Some of the effects of withdrawal can be fatal.<br/><br/>
    You are not alone in this journey. Speak to a trusted adult or healthcare practitioner about problematic substance use.<br/><br/>

<div class="card-body">
          <b>What is self-harm?</b></br>
Self-harm is when we hurt ourselves without suicidal intent, and this often leaves damage to our body.<br/><br/>
        <b>What is suicide?</b><br/>
        Suicide means ending your own life. It is sometimes a way for people to escape pain or suffering. When someone ends their own life, we say that they "died by suicide." A "suicide attempt" means that someone tried to end their life, but did not die. Often you will also hear "suicidal ideation", which means thinking about suicide or wanting to take your own life</br></br>

  <b>Why do I feel like harming myself or comitting suicide?
</b></br>
Sometimes one can just have a thought about self-harm or suicide, and there is nothing more to it. Other times, the thoughts can be very real, and self-harm and suicide is perceivd as "way out" from a difficult time or stressor in your life. Self-harm can sometimes manifest into suicide.</br></br>

  <b>Why do I feel this way?</b></br>
There can be many reasons. Losing a parent, having an illness, family troubles, abusive family history, traumatic experiences, and lack of positive role models or friends are all factors that increase one's risk.</br></br>

       <b>How do I get help?</b><br/>
You may consider speaking to crisis services or your family doctor. Crisis services are available 24/7 to help provide you further resources and support you if you are in immediate danger. A family doctor can help you better understand these behaviours and refer you to a mental healthcare worker for further treatment.<br/><br/>
